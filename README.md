ABSTRACT:
COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of effective diagnostic tools for managing respiratory complications.
CT imaging is a non-invasive and essential modality for detecting and assessing induced lung lesions.
CT imaging is particularly valuable when RT-PCR tests provide inconsistent results.
Manual lung CT scan analysis is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human variability.
The necessity for automated, reliable image segmentation methods to enhance clinical decision-making.
Lung lesian remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with approximately 1.8 million fatalities in 2020.

MOTIVATION:
Overcome the limitations of manual CT scan interpretation, such as subjectivity and delays.
Enable faster and more reliable identification of lung lesions in patients. 
Leverage deep learning to segment even small and complex lesion areas with high precision.
Contribute to public health efforts in managing and mitigating lung lesion impacts.
Reduce radiologists workload during pandemic peaks by automating lesion segmentation.
Provide consistent and objective outputs, reducing errors due to fatigue or expertise variability using CNN, U-Net and SegNet.
